# Planetterp Grade Bias
Planetterp (https://planetterp.com) is a website that allows University of Maryland students to rate and review their professors and courses, as well as display grade data for each course. Each semester, many students use these ratings to determine if they want to take a class with a certain professor. However, if these ratings are biased, students may not be making decisions that are well informed.

This is a tutorial where I explore the extent to which grades in a certain class affect its ratings.
